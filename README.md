This is **`the Unknown Groups`** website where there'll be a list of all respositories that are created and will soon be updated with features to make it more fun and interactive <spoiler>TBD</spoiler>!

Currently, the website is still "under construction" and will take a bit of time. During this time though, the current list of repositories can be found by clicking below!

        <summary> ‚ùì Unknown Mod! </summary>
         This is the very first mod that we created many months ago but never published it to anything! 
        <br><br>
        
       It adds two blocks into the game, and has some configurations for publishing and fancier details!

      <details>
        <summary> üñåÔ∏è Custom Splashes! </summary>
         This is the first published resource pack that we put out to the world. It may not be our first resource pack that we've ever made but its certainly not the last.
         <br><br>
        
       It adds custom splashes--the yellow text below the giant **`MINECRAFT`** logo on the main title screen of Minecraft! You are able to customize it to your liking or keep it as is.

        This is the very first repository ever made by [Devon K]() who is also the owner of [the Unknown Group]()! He made this a year or so ago to help store his python, java, javascript, c++ and html projects!
